## Interacting With The User Interface

  Once the program is running there will be several inputs. The first input is for gender and the next 3 are for entering your age, weight in pounds, and height 
  in inches. Upon entering this information your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) will be displayed below the input section in real time. This is also true for the table

  or gain weight.
